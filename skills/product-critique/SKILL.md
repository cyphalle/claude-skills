description: "Have isolated subagents critique a product artefact (design, prototype, screen, spec, deck, post): as a simulated customer persona who tries to use it, as a blind judge who sees only the output, or as a pre-mortem on the decisions of a tech spec. Use when finishing a spec or a prototype, before publishing, or when the user asks for a second opinion, a simulated user test, a blind read, a devil's advocate, or 'what can break'."

# product-critique

Three protocols that answer three different questions:

| Protocol | Question | When |
|---|---|---|
| A. Simulated persona | Would a real customer understand it and manage to use it? | after a spec or a prototype |
| B. Blind judge | Does the artefact stand on its own, without its author's argument? | before publishing a spec, a deck, a post |
| C. Pre-mortem | Do the choices in the spec survive three months of production? | before coding on the autonomy path of `spec` |

All three use the same mechanism: **several subagents, isolated, that never see each
other**. And the same reading rule: **convergence is the signal, an isolated opinion is not**.

## The convergence rule: apply it before you change anything

- **2 critics out of 3 or more point at the same spot**: a real defect. Fix it.
- **Only 1 points at it**: note it, do not fix it. An isolated judge produces argued
  noise, which is more dangerous than silence.
- **Three different phrasings about the same screen or sentence** count as convergence.
  Group by the spot targeted. Wording does not matter.

The main failure mode is to apply every list: three agents return three plausible lists,
you apply them all, and the design grows without getting better.

## Protocol A: simulated user test

**What it is worth.** About two thirds of a real user test, with nobody mobilised. It is a
plausibility simulation. Nobody observed a real customer. Persona feedback never replaces a customer
call. It avoids burning a call on an obvious problem.

### Feed the persona real verbatims first

Before you launch, search your call transcripts for what real customers said about the
subject under test, and paste those quotes in the persona prompt verbatim, with name and
date.

**The speaker filter is not optional.** One measurement on a call archive: of 87
"I don't understand" phrases found, 69 were spoken by the vendor's own team and 18 by
customers. Without filtering out your own speakers, you feed the persona your own pitch,
and it hands your words back. The test becomes a mirror.

When a verbatim contradicts the persona sheet, the sheet is wrong. Fix it and date the fix.

### Run

1. Pick the personas the artefact concerns. Do not run all of them by reflex: a portfolio
   screen does not concern a corporate sustainability persona, and forcing it produces a
   false negative.
2. Launch one subagent per persona, in parallel, in the same message. Each one gets the
   full persona sheet, the artefact alone (never the author's intent, criteria or "why"),
   the mode, and the instruction to stay in character including in confusion: if it does
   not know a word, it says so and does not guess.
3. Two modes:
   - **Research**: "how do you do X today?" Before the prototype.
   - **Evaluation**: "here is the screen, try to do X." After the prototype.
4. Imposed return grid, in this order:

```
1. What I understand of this screen in 5 seconds
2. What I try to do, and in which order I click
3. Where I get stuck, or what I misread
4. The word or the number I cannot interpret
5. What I would do instead if it does not work (workaround)
6. Would I report this to my vendor, or live with it?
```

Point 6 sorts: what a customer silently lives with never comes up in a call.

5. Cross the returns by spot, apply the convergence rule, and feed back only convergences.

## Protocol B: blind judge

**The point that does all the work**: the judge evaluates in a separate context, without
the author's reasoning. An agent asked to critique its own work in the same thread is
conditioned by its own argument. It defends instead of evaluating.

1. Extract the output alone. For a spec: the `## Design` section as it will be read in the
   issue. Nothing from the conversation.
2. Launch 2 or 3 judges in parallel, with deliberately different angles:

| Artefact | Judges |
|---|---|
| Design of an issue | the product sceptic ("what proves this problem exists?"), the hurried reader (30 seconds, titles and criteria only), the technical owner of the surface |
| Tech spec | the PR reviewer ("what will I have to re-read?"), the maintainer in 6 months ("why this choice, and what breaks if I change it?") |
| Deck, post, announcement | the expert reader, the novice reader, the distracted reader who scrolls |

3. Each judge returns a short verdict:

```
Verdict: stands / does not stand
The point that does not stand: <one, the most serious>
What is missing to decide: <one line, or "nothing">
```

4. Convergence: fix. Divergence: the artefact is probably right and the judges speculate.

## Protocol C: pre-mortem on decisions

**The question**: three months from now, the PR was reverted or the displayed figure was
wrong. Why? Protocol B judges whether the artefact reads. Protocol C judges whether its
choices hold.

1. Extract the approach and the decisions of the tech spec, plus the acceptance criteria.
2. Launch 2 fresh agents in parallel:
   - **Pre-mortem**: "The PR is reverted in three months. Write the 3 most likely failure
     stories. Each names a precise trigger, a two-step chain of effects, and the sign we
     could have seen before."
   - **Evidence audit**: "For each decision, say what would make it false, and whether the
     spec shows it is not. Flag any decision nothing can refute."
3. Each returns at most 3 points, most serious first:

```
Point: <decision or part of the approach>
Failure: <trigger, effect, effect>
Counter: <concrete spec change, or "test to write: ...">
```

4. Same convergence rule. A point both agents hit: fix the spec before publishing. An
   isolated point with a cheap counter (a test, a guard): add it to the criteria. The rest:
   drop it.
5. **Steelman first**: each agent restates the decision in its strongest form before it
   attacks. No pile of small objections to make up numbers.

## What must not happen

- A judge that took part. If it saw the reasoning, its verdict is worthless.
- A fix on an isolated opinion.
- A persona on a subject that does not concern it.
- **Persona feedback presented as customer data.** In an issue or a PR, write
  `Simulated persona feedback (<persona>)`. Never "customers say".

## Headless use

When a scheduled job calls this skill on issue numbers, write the result into the issue
body under `## Simulated persona feedback`, appended below the design, which stays untouched. The
dispatcher uses that heading to know an issue was tested. One first run posted its
analysis to a chat message and touched no issue: both issues would have been re-tested
30 minutes later, at six to nine subagents each. No mention, no status change: the
simulation runs before human review and does not replace it.
