name: handoff
description: "Hand the subject of the current session to a human teammate: open or reuse a GitHub issue, post a takeover file (what is decided, what is theirs to decide, the next concrete step), swap the assignee, and set the status that names the act you ask of them. Use when the user says /handoff <person> or wants someone else to finish a topic."

# handoff

You opened a topic, iterated on it, and made it clearer. Someone else must now take it over
the finish line. This skill turns the current session into a takeover file and hands it to
that person by name.

## The one success criterion

**The person who takes over starts without asking you a single question.** The issue is the
container. The deliverable is the restart. In three minutes of reading, someone who did not live the
conversation must know what is expected of them, what is already settled and must not be
reopened, and what they do first on Monday morning.

The failure mode is not an issue that is too short. It is an issue that suggests
everything is still open. The new owner then replays the iteration you just paid for,
lands somewhere else, and the handoff cost more than it returned. Hence two sections that
are not negotiable: **Decided** and **Yours to decide**. An idea with nothing in the first
section is not a handoff.

## Step 0: arguments

| Fragment | Effect |
|---|---|
| a name from the owners table | sets the new owner |
| a number | the issue or PR that receives the file (PR first, then issue) |
| `--new` | forces a new issue |
| `--dry-run` | prepares everything, shows the file, writes nothing |
| empty | everything is inferred from the session |

## Step 1: what you hand over

Answer three questions before you touch GitHub.

1. **What is the subject?** One sentence, phrased as an expected outcome. If you cannot,
   the session covered several subjects. Do not merge them into a catch-all issue.
2. **What is settled?** Decisions taken, paths closed, constraints found, files read,
   things measured. This is the capital of the session, and `/clear` erases it.
3. **What remains open?** For each open question: do you delegate it, or settle it now?

**Emptiness guard.** If you cannot write one "Decided" line and one next action at file or
command level, there is no handoff, there is an idea. Say so and route it to issue
capture. Dressing a bare idea as a takeover file has the cost of delegation and the yield
of a sticky note.

**Scope.** Work that exists only on your disk cannot be handed over. Commit and push on a
feature branch and cite it. Never commit on the base branch.

## Step 2: the container

In order of preference. A new issue is the last resort: a duplicate costs the new owner
the reconciliation you spared them elsewhere.

- **a. An existing issue carries the subject.** Post the file as a comment, swap the
  assignee, move the status, keep the priority. Do not rewrite the body, except to add a
  section the session produced.
- **b. A PR is open on the subject.** Do not create anything. Comment on the PR, make the
  new owner its assignee, keep the layer reviewer. Say whether you expect them to finish
  the PR or restart it.
- **c. Nothing exists.** New issue.

## Step 3: who, and which act

Infer the owner from the domain with the owners table of `config.md`. On a topic that
spans domains, pick the first step: a topic that starts with a methodology decision and
ends on a screen goes to the methodology owner, with a line saying the rest goes to the
frontend owner. Split now with one sub-issue per owner. One issue keeps one assignee.

**The status is the act you ask for.** The new owner reads it on the board without opening
the issue.

| What you ask | Status | Line in the file |
|---|---|---|
| Decide the science, formula, threshold | `To methodo` | Decide the method, then hand it back for design. |
| Frame the product: screens, criteria, scope | `To design` | Design it: screens, acceptance criteria, out of scope. |
| It is designed and specified, build it | `To dev` | Build it. The spec is in the body, open points below. |
| Take over the open PR | linked issues `In Progress` | Take over the PR: what is left is listed below. |

**The status moves back when the act is upstream of the current status.** An issue in
`Dev to review` whose PR merged, with a slice not started, goes back to `To dev`. Check two
things first: what shipped is closed (cite the merged PR under Decided), and no downstream
work is in progress.

**Owners who ratify on the diff.** For owners marked "ratify on the diff only" in
`config.md`, an open question sent cold often gets no answer, and the work waits. Turn each
question you pass them into a decided choice to ratify: write the decision, its one-line
reason and the rejected alternative, and ask "ratify or correct". The section becomes
`To ratify or correct`. Two exceptions: the artefact is already theirs, or the data exists
nowhere and you cannot produce it. Then say exactly which data is missing and where you
looked. Owners who hold firm technical opinions get real open questions: those help them.

## Step 4: the takeover file

Two surfaces in one artefact: the essentials readable in 90 seconds, then the agent context
folded in a `<details>` block.

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Handoff** from @<you> to @<handle> · <YYYY-MM-DD> · **you own this now**
> Asked act: <decide the method | design it | build it | take over the PR>

## What I want
<2 to 4 lines. The outcome, in terms of what a customer sees.>

## Why now
<1 to 3 lines: what triggered it, what it unblocks, what it costs to leave it.>

## Decided (do not reopen)
- <decision>: <why, half a line>. Dropped: <the alternative and why not>.

## Yours to decide
- <question>. My read: <what I would do>. I did not decide it because <reason>.

## Next concrete step
<The first thing to do. File level or command level. "Start the analysis" does not qualify.>

## Dead ends
- <what I tried, where it broke, so you do not pay for it twice>

## Where the work stands
- Branch: `<branch>` · last commit `<sha>` · PR #<n> (draft|ready) | no code yet
- Touched: `<path>`, `<path>`

## Still mine
<Only when you hand over a part. What you keep, why, and when you come back to it.>

## If you disagree
The premise above is mine. If you think it is wrong, say so in a comment before writing
code. Reopening it costs a comment now and a week later.

<details>
<summary>Full context, written for an agent</summary>

<Table and column names, payload shapes, edge cases, constraints that look obvious, queries
run and what they returned, what was ruled out and why. Be generous: an agent has no
intuition to fill a gap, and every silent assumption becomes a decision it takes alone and
badly, visible three PRs later.>

</details>
```

**Write "Still mine" as soon as you hand over a part**, and delete it when you hand over the
whole. Without it, the new owner believes they inherit everything and stalls on the piece
that needed your call. A vague delay ("later") empties it: they will not know whether to
wait or move on.

**Mentioning someone is asking them a question.** If you cite a third person, write what
you expect from them next to the name, or `FYI` if nothing.

## Step 5: fields

- **New issue**: the file as body, a `### Priority` section, exactly one assignee (the new
  owner), the issue type, the status.
- **Existing issue**: the file as comment, then swap the assignee. Read the current one and
  remove it in the same command you add the new one. `--add-assignee` alone stacks a second
  assignee, and an issue with two names has no owner.

**Priority cap.** A handoff puts work in someone else's calendar. "Today" on a third
party's calendar is a prioritisation decision you take in their place. Cap at "This week"
unless the user asked for more in the current turn. An existing issue keeps its priority:
the handoff changes the owner and the act, it does not re-prioritise the board.

## Step 6: the signal

An assigned issue announced nowhere waits for the next time someone opens the board. Draft
a direct message (never send it yourself) under 600 characters. No greeting word: the
first line is the act.

```
I handed you #<n>: <subject>. Act: <build it>. Start with <next step>. Settled: <one line>.
```

## Step 7: report

Container (link), new owner, status before and after, priority, and the message drafted.
