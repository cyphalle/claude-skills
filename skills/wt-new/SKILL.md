# wt-new

`/wt-new` is a prefix. It creates an isolated worktree, moves the session into it, then
starts the work described in the argument. It never touches the current checkout.

```
/wt-new https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/123   worktree, then solve the issue
/wt-new /fix-bug 123                                   worktree, then run /fix-bug inside
/wt-new restore the sort by score on the sites table   worktree, then implement
/wt-new api/feat/kml-import                            worktree only
/wt-new 456                                            worktree on the branch of PR #456
```

## Why

When several agent sessions run in parallel on the same clone, the main checkout is shared
space. Writing there corrupts the work of the other sessions: files change under their
feet, `git status` lies, and the checked-out branch changes mid-run.

## Contract

1. **Creating the worktree is the first action of the run.** Before it, no file read,
   edit, search or mutating git command in the current checkout. Only commands that do not
   touch the working tree are allowed: `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `git ls-remote`,
   `git fetch`, `git worktree list`, `git show-ref`.
2. **No guard stops the run.** A name collision, an occupied folder, a branch already
   taken: each of these has a resolution in step 3. None aborts the run.
3. **Work starts only after the assertion of step 4c passes.** If it fails, stop and say
   so. Never fall back to the main checkout.

"It is a one-liner, the worktree is overkill" is forbidden reasoning. Isolation does not
protect against diff size. It protects against the other sessions.

## Step 0: mode

- **Mode B, fix an existing branch**: the argument is a PR number or URL, a branch that
  exists on `origin`, or an explicit intent to resume one. Check out the existing branch
  so commits update the PR.
- **Mode A, new work**: everything else. New branch from the up-to-date base.

Never guess a new branch name over an existing one. If the resolved branch exists on
`origin`, it is Mode B.

A bare number is ambiguous: try a PR first, then an issue. An issue URL (`/issues/<n>`)
is Mode A. A PR URL (`/pull/<n>`) is Mode B.

## Step 0b: split the seed from the workload

| Argument | Seed (names the branch) | Workload (after setup) |
|---|---|---|
| a conforming branch name | the name | none |
| a PR number or URL | the PR head branch | none by default |
| an issue number or URL | issue title and labels | solve the issue |
| a slash command | what the command targets | the command, as is |
| a free prompt | the subject of the prompt | the prompt, as is |

## Step 1: branch name

Mode A follows the branch convention of `config.md`. Infer scope, type and a 3-5 word
slug without asking. Announce the inferred name in the report.

Folder slug: the branch name with `/` replaced by `-`.

## Step 2: location

Derive it from the current repository. Never hard-code it.

```bash
MAIN=$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")
WT="$(dirname "$MAIN")/$(basename "$MAIN")-worktrees/<slug>"
```

## Step 3: guards resolve, they do not stop

| Situation | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Mode A, the branch exists and a worktree holds it | another session works there. Never attach to it. Suffix `-2`, `-3` |
| Mode A, the branch exists, no worktree holds it | a dormant branch: switch to Mode B and resume it |
| Mode B, a worktree already holds the branch | that is the worktree you want: move into it, and report any work in progress there |
| Mode B, the branch exists nowhere | nothing to fix: switch to Mode A, say so |
| The target folder is an unregistered leftover | suffix the folder name. The branch name stays |

The only legitimate stop: the seed resolves nothing (a number that is neither PR nor
issue). Say so in one line. Nothing was touched in the main checkout.

## Step 4: create

Mode A:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add -b "$BR" "$WT" origin/<base>
git -C "$WT" push -u origin "$BR"
```

Mode B:

```bash
git fetch origin "$BR"
git worktree add "$WT" "$BR" 2>/dev/null \
  || git worktree add --track -b "$BR" "$WT" "origin/$BR"
```

### 4b. Copy the gitignored local config

A new worktree has no gitignored file: the code compiles, and does not run. Copy local
config files (for example `.env.local`) from the main checkout, without overwriting.

```bash
find "$MAIN" \( -name node_modules -o -name target -o -name .git \) -prune -o \
  -name '.env.local' -type f -print | while read -r f; do
  dest="$WT/${f#"$MAIN"/}"
  [ -e "$dest" ] || { mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest")" && cp "$f" "$dest"; }
done
```

For Rust: the `target/` folder is shared between worktrees, so two sessions that compile
at the same time block each other or return phantom errors. Isolate any run that counts
in a sibling folder: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$WT-target"`. Sibling, because `.gitignore` covers
`target/` only.

### 4c. Assert you are in the worktree

```bash
test "$(git -C "$WT" rev-parse --show-toplevel)" = "$(cd "$WT" && pwd -P)" \
  && test "$(git -C "$WT" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" = "$BR" \
  && echo "WT-OK" || echo "WT-KO"
```

`WT-KO`: stop and say so.

## Step 5: move the session

Prefer the harness worktree tool so the session cwd follows. If it refuses, `cd` and use
absolute paths under `$WT` for every file tool: a shell `cd` does not move the file tools.
From here on, any command that names the main checkout path is a bug.

## Step 6: report, then work

Report mode, branch, path, base, and copied config files, in 2-3 lines when a workload
follows. Then start the workload without asking. The worktree was created to work in it.
If the seed is an issue, move it to `In Progress` before the first line of code.
