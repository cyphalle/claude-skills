# clearable

Check that the session can be cleared without losing anything, fix what is missing, and
say where the work stands.

The question is not "is git clean?". There are two questions, independent of each other,
and each one gives its own verdict:

1. **What context exists only in this conversation?** A green `git status` says nothing
   about design decisions, accepted limitations, or a PR that became conflicting. That is
   exactly what a `/clear` loses, and it is the most expensive thing to rebuild.
   Verdict: **GO / NO-GO**.
2. **Do we hold a good first version, or do we come back to it?** That is the question
   the user asks themselves when they type the command. Neither git nor the board answers
   it. Verdict: **v1 that holds / follow-up**.

A session can be GO and in follow-up, or NO-GO on finished work. Never fold one verdict
into the other.

Three durable supports, by order of reliability: **git** (committed and pushed), then
**GitHub** (PR body, issue comment), then **memory** files. Anything not yet in one of
them exists only in the thread.

## Step 1: scope

A session often touches several repositories. Re-read the conversation, list every
repository where work happened, and note what was done in each.

If the session was purely conversational (research, a question, reading) and produced no
file and no reusable decision, the verdict is GO. Say it in one line and stop. Do not
invent tidying work.

## Step 2: git, does the work exist off the disk?

```bash
git status --porcelain
git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD
git branch --show-current
git worktree list
```

Separate work from noise. A build directory or a generated file is not context to save:
mention it and move on. Blocking on noise makes people stop trusting the verdict.

- Uncommitted on a feature branch: commit and push. Lost work costs more than an imperfect
  commit.
- Uncommitted on the base or release branch: stop. Never commit there. Propose a branch.
- Detached HEAD: propose a branch on the current commit. Check `git stash list` too: some
  GUI tools auto-stash before they detach.
- A linked worktree left over: if the branch is checked out there, the main checkout
  cannot reach it. Check it is clean and pushed, remove the worktree, and check the branch
  out where the user works.

## Step 3: GitHub, does the PR tell the story?

```bash
gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,url,isDraft,mergeable,statusCheckRollup
```

- **Commits and no PR**: the most expensive case. The work is pushed, and nothing records
  why. Open the PR with `open-pr`. A draft beats nothing.
- **Conflicting PR**: say which commits arrived and which files conflict
  (`git merge-tree`). "Conflict" and "conflict on the file I just refactored" are not the
  same amount of work. Resolve it if it is mechanical.
- **Red CI**: report it.
- **Body**: it must hold what a reviewer cannot infer from the diff.

## Step 4: the context written nowhere

This is the core of the skill. Re-read the conversation and look for:

- design decisions and the alternatives set aside;
- accepted limitations and conscious debt;
- dead ends, so nobody pays for them twice;
- facts measured during the session that the code does not show.

Each one goes to the PR body, an issue comment, or a memory file. Creating a new issue
needs the user's approval. Writing a comment does not.

## Step 5: is it a v1 that holds?

Plainly: does what was delivered defend itself if nobody comes back to it? Decide it
yourself, on observable facts. Do not hand the question back to the user. It is exactly
what they expect the command to answer.

| Signal | Where to read it |
|---|---|
| The acceptance criteria are covered | the issue, compared with the diff |
| CI green, and the new path has a test | `statusCheckRollup`, test files in the diff |
| No `TODO` / `FIXME` added in this session | `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD \| grep -nE 'TODO\|FIXME'` |
| PR out of draft, reviewer and assignee set | `isDraft`, `reviewRequests` |

**v1 that holds**: open points may remain if none blocks use. Mark the PR ready, move the
issues, and write one line on what v1 covers and one line on what it does not. The second
line is the one that stops people from believing the feature is complete three weeks
later.

**Follow-up**: the trace must pass the cold-restart test. A new session that reads only
the trace starts again without asking a single question. It carries the stop point
(branch, last commit, worktree), the next action at file level, and what was tried and
failed. An issue title does not pass this test. A paragraph does.

**A third case**: an explored path that was dropped. The deliverable is what was learned.
It belongs in a comment or a memory. Do not open a follow-up issue nobody will pick up.

## Step 6: memory

A durable lesson goes to memory: a correction from the user on how you work, a confirmed
preference, a project constraint the repo does not show. Do not store what the code or
the git log already says. Enrich an existing memory before you create a second one.

## Step 7: verdict

End with a verdict readable at a glance. It carries both axes.

```markdown
## GO: the session can be cleared
## v1 that holds

The commodity filter works end to end on the three screens concerned.
It does not handle multi-select: tracked in #<n>, it blocks nobody.

| Support | State |
|---|---|
| Git | 3 commits pushed, worktree removed |
| PR | #<n> ready, body up to date, CI green, reviewer set |
| Issues | #<n> linked, moved to Dev to review |
| Memory | 1 memory enriched |
```

```markdown
## NO-GO: 2 points to handle before clearing
## Follow-up: 1 slice left

1. PR #<n> conflicts: the base took 5 commits, one touches the 2 refactored files.
2. Decision not recorded: the axis rescale choice is written nowhere.

Fixed automatically: commit and push of 2 files, worktree removed.
Cold restart: comment posted on #<n> with the stop point, the next action, the dropped path.
```

With `--dry-run`, give the same verdict, change nothing, and list what you would have done.

When a blocking point needs real work, do not start it. The user who types this command
is tidying up. Reopening a workstream is a separate decision. Describe what remains, create the durable
trace, and offer to do it now.
