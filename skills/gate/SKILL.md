description: "Run a feature issue through ten ordered yes/no gates with early exit. The blocking gate is the verdict. Posts one advice comment and one label. It advises and decides nothing: no priority, status, assignee or body change. Use when a feature enters the backlog, or when the user says /gate <issue>, /gate all."

# gate

Send a feature issue through an ordered list of binary questions. Exit at the first gate
that blocks, and that gate is the verdict. This replaces weighted scoring for the question
"should this enter design?". It does not replace prioritisation.

## Why gates and not a score

A score compensates. A low "value" mark is rescued by a high "effort" mark, and nobody can
re-read a number six weeks later. A gate does not compensate, and it produces a readable
reason: "blocked by: we already have this". A real case: a signal from an important customer can rightly be `Skip` because the capability already exists. A
weighted score would have let the customer weight hide the redundancy.

## What the gate does, and the line it never crosses

The gate gives advice. It decides nothing and triggers nothing. Following the advice
belongs to the issue owner alone.

It writes two things only:

1. **One advice comment** with the verdict, its reason, and the gate-by-gate table. A new
   pass edits the existing comment, found by its `<!-- gate:advice -->` marker.
2. **One label**: `gate:skip`, `gate:not-for-now`, `gate:quick-win` or `gate:epic`,
   swapped so that only one is present. A label is a board filter. It is not a decision.

It never touches the priority field, the board status, the assignee, or the body.
It never starts a spec, a plan, an implementation, or a build.

**Why the line is there.** The first version wrote a section into the body and reassigned
retained items to the lead. The team read it as decisions taken in their place. The log
also showed it rejected 55% of full evaluations and 34% of sanity checks. Moving to a
comment and a label, and relaxing gates 8 and 9, fixed both. A comment reads as advice
anyone can ignore. A section in the body reads as a rewrite of the ticket.

## The ten gates, in order

### Series 1: sanity check (removes about a third of signals)

| # | Gate | Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Value | If we built exactly what is asked, would it create real value? | Jobs-to-be-done list with opportunity scores, customer mentions on the issue |
| 2 | Not redundant | Do we already have a way to do it? Blocks only if the existing feature covers the need as asked. Partial coverage passes, with `extends <path or #issue>` as evidence | The codebase, explored for real; changelogs; closed issues |
| 3 | Not in progress | Does an open workstream already handle it? | Open issues in `To dev`, `In Progress`, `Dev to review`; open PRs |

### Series 2: quick-win path

| # | Gate | Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | Coherent, no bloat | Does it fit the product concepts, and reuse a concept rather than create one? | The concept registry of the repository. A rule quoted from it is evidence. "It looks coherent" is not |
| 5 | Code choice only | Is it only code, with no architecture or structural decision? | The decision level decides. Size plays no part. Test: would it deserve an ADR? If yes, it is out |
| 6 | Straightforward | Can you write the test that fails today and passes once done? | If the issue does not let you write it, it needs a judgment, and judgment comes before implementation. Any open question or any methodology choice also blocks |
| 7 | Legal and compliance | Any legal or contractual risk? | Privacy, what a published figure may claim, and above all data licences: redistribution rights differ by dataset |

### Series 3: epic path (legitimate, too big for a quick win)

| # | Gate | Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | Strategy fit | Does it serve one strategic axis? Passes as soon as it serves one, even outside the current quarter. Blocks only if it leaves every axis or contradicts one | Strategic axes and quarter items |
| 9 | Dealbreaker | Is it a deal-breaking criterion for a real open account? Never blocks alone. A proven dealbreaker passes and rescues a blocked gate 8 | CRM deals and call transcripts, crossed |
| 10 | ROI fit | Realistic to solve for the investment? | T-shirt effort against opportunity score and the count of accounts that carry it |

Gate 9 is evaluated even when gate 8 blocks. It is the one exception to early exit.

**Gate 9 is decided on two sources.** A keyword with zero hits in the call
archive reads as "nobody asks for it", and that can be false: the request may have arrived
through email, a deal, or a founders' channel that leaves no trace in calls. A zero in one
source is an invitation to cross-check. It is never a conclusion.

## Gate 5 measures a decision level

| Level | Reversibility | ADR? |
|---|---|---|
| Code choice | a PR is enough | no |
| Architecture choice | reversible but expensive: migration, cutover, recompute | yes |
| Structural choice | irreversible in practice: external contract, lost data, dependency spread everywhere | yes, decided slowly |

Two earlier phrasings failed and are worth keeping as history:

- "At most two logic files" was too strict: zero quick wins on 108 evaluations. In a
  hexagonal codebase the smallest useful change crosses a domain type, a service, a
  handler, a component and their tests.
- "No irreversible consequence" was too wide: almost everything in code is revertable.

Both measured size or cost of return. The right axis is who decides, and when.

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Condition |
|---|---|
| `Skip` | a series 1 gate blocks |
| `Quick Win` | gates 1 to 7 pass |
| `Epic` | gates 1-3 and 8-10 pass, 4-7 not all passed |
| `Not for now` | gates 1-3 pass, and gate 8 blocks without a gate 9 rescue, or gate 10 blocks |
| `Sanity passed` | `--sanity` mode, gates 1-3 pass. Label `gate:to-assess` |

An `unknown` gate (source unreachable) does not pass. Never turn it into a yes for comfort.

A `Skip` does not close the issue. It stays open with its label and written reason. That is
what you want to find when the same request comes back three months later, and an issue
closed by a machine upsets the person who opened it.

**Suspend `Quick Win` when nothing consumes it.** If no agent reads the `gate:quick-win`
queue, the label promises an agent that will not come. Evaluate series 3 instead, and keep
the true verdict in the log for replay.

## Two regimes by owner

| Assignee | What the gate writes |
|---|---|
| you | the advice comment and the `gate:quick-win` label |
| someone else | a comment only. The label is their consent to give |

Never put the quick-win label on someone else's issue. An agent consumes that label, so
the label is the consent.

## Batch: sanity check first

Hundreds of items do not go through ten gates each. Run `--sanity` (gates 1-3) in batches
of 10 to 15: load the shared sources once per batch (jobs list, open issues, concept
registry). Then run the full gate on the `gate:to-assess` survivors.

Do not filter the backlog on upvotes before gating. Everything that enters the backlog
passes the sanity check. Upvotes order the queue; they do not condition entry.

## Trigger

- At the end of issue capture, while context is fresh.
- By hand: `/gate <n>`, `/gate <n> <n>`, `/gate all --max <n>`.
- A watcher every 30 minutes on working hours that detects entries into `To design`, by
  difference with the previous pass. Detect the entry into the status. An item that
  moves to design weeks after it was opened would be missed by a date filter.

Event-driven gating on issue creation was rejected on purpose: some gates read local
archives absent from CI runners, and an issue gated in the second it is born has no
upvotes yet. The 30-minute delay is a property.

## Advice comment format

At most 500 visible characters before a `<details>` block that holds the gate table.

```markdown
<!-- gate:advice -->
**Gate advice: Epic.** Passes value, redundancy and strategy. Gate 5 blocks: it needs a
schema migration (would deserve an ADR). This is advice. The owner decides.

<details><summary>Gate by gate</summary>

| # | Gate | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Value | pass | job "<job>", score 7.2, 3 mentions |
| ... |

</details>
```

## Log

Every verdict goes to a local JSONL log, written or not on GitHub. Without the log, the
distribution of verdicts cannot be measured, and a gate you cannot measure cannot be
calibrated.
