description: "Write the product design and the technical spec of a feature on its GitHub issue in one pass, after reading the code. Then ask one question: go autonomous (implement and open the PR, review happens on the diff) or sync first (an owner decides before code). Use when an issue is ready to be designed, or when the user says /spec <issue>."

# spec

Take a feature issue and produce, in one pass, what we want (product) and how we build it
(tech). Then ask one question only: do we go autonomous up to the pull request, or does an
owner need to decide something before anyone writes code?

## Why one pass

A design written without reading the code starts from a wrong premise. In the case that
created this skill, the design said "where the list of commodities appears". No screen
listed them. Only the code exploration of the spec revealed it, after the design was
published and sign-off was requested. Writing both in one pass forces the exploration to
happen before the promise is written.

## Why autonomy is the default

A diff is easier to judge than an intention. The old cycle asked the team to validate a
product design, then a spec, then opened the PR: three waits for a review that only really
bit on the diff. With this skill, design, spec, implementation and PR can land in one
session, with the stakeholders as reviewers on the PR.

The sync path is rare, and it exists. Coding a structural decision, or a methodology that
does not exist yet, sends a diff to review on a question nobody settled. The review then
becomes a deliberation.

## Inputs

- An issue number or URL: `gh issue view <n> --json title,body,comments,projectItems`.
- Nothing: list the issues in `To design` and ask which one.
- `all`: batch mode. Write only the `## Tech spec` on every `To dev` issue that has a
  `## Design` and no spec. Draft all, show one grouped recap, wait for one global go, then
  publish in series. No path question and no implementation in batch mode.

### Status precondition

| Status | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `To design` | nominal case |
| `Design to review` | read `## Design` and the thread; complete what is missing, do not rewrite a validated design |
| `To dev` without `## Tech spec` | write the spec, then ask the path question |
| `To dev` with `## Tech spec` | ask the path question directly |
| `In Progress`, `Dev to review` | development started: warn, continue only on confirmation |
| closed or deployed | block, explicit confirmation required |

## Process

1. **Read the issue**: body, comments, linked issues (parent, sub-issues, data handoffs).
   A data dictionary posted on a sibling issue can change the scope.
2. **Explore the code before writing the design.** This is the reason the two documents
   are merged.
   - Where does the user see this today? Which screen, component, endpoint, query? What
     does it show in the target case: empty, hidden, wrong?
   - Is the premise of the issue true in the code? If not, write the design on reality and
     say where the issue diverges.
   - Past three searches, dispatch an exploration agent with precise questions and demand
     verified paths.
   - Read `git show origin/<base>:<path>` rather than the shared working tree, which may be
     hundreds of commits behind.
3. **Read the ADRs.** A reused ADR is cited. A structural decision that no ADR covers is a
   signal for the sync path.
4. **Draft** `## Design` and `## Tech spec`, plus a path recommendation with a one-line
   reason.
5. **Critique** with the `product-critique` skill. Fix only what at least two critics
   converge on. Run the pre-mortem protocol every time you recommend autonomy and the
   `Decisions` list is not empty: autonomy removes the review before code, so the
   pre-mortem takes its place.
6. **Ask the path question.** It is the only question of the run.
7. **Publish**, then run the chosen path.

Decide everything else yourself: owner, priority, placement, code choices, ratifiable
methodology choices. Each one gets a one-line justification. None becomes a question.

## Format

Plain markdown. Keep both headings verbatim: other skills read them.

```markdown
## Design

**Why**
<2-4 sentences. User pain and business reason. Cite mentions or incidents (#N).>

**What we want**
<2-4 sentences, in user terms. What the user can do or see that they could not before.>

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] When <condition>, the user sees / can <observable result>

**Out of scope (v2+)**
- <deferred item, with its issue number when one exists>

**Candidate owner**
<name, or TBD>
```

The design stays pure product: no file, endpoint or component. It is written after the
exploration, so it describes screens that exist. 15 to 25 lines.

```markdown
## Tech spec

### Existing
- `path/to/file.rs:42`: <what is already there>

### Approach
<2-4 sentences. Layer, pattern, what is added where. Reuses ADR-XXX. No pseudo-code.>

### Open questions
- <tech question the implementer settles on the way, only if it truly stays open>

### Decisions (to ratify in PR)
- <choice made>. Rejected: <alternative>. Why: <one line>. Source: stated (#N) | code (`path`) | assumed. Ratifier: <owner>, in PR review.

### ADRs
- Reuses: ADR-XXX
- Candidate new ADR: <topic>, or none
```

20 to 30 lines. Check every cited path with `git cat-file -e origin/<base>:<path>`.

**The `Source:` field decides who ratifies.** `stated` means the issue or a comment already
decided it. `code` means the spec applies a value already in place. `assumed` means the
spec introduces or changes it. Only `assumed` names a ratifier. A choice with no source
you can cite is `assumed`.

A methodology or data question (formula, threshold, unit, source, reference table,
aggregation rule, perimeter) never becomes an open question for a "ratify on the diff"
owner. You settle it and list it under `Decisions`. The one exception is the sync
methodology case below.

## The path criterion: the decision level

| What the feature asks to decide | Path | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Code choices, even across many layers | autonomy | one PR makes the choice and can undo it |
| A methodology choice ratifiable on a diff: label, threshold, unit, an already chosen source | autonomy, ratified in PR | the reviewer judges a written choice and invents nothing |
| Architecture: schema migration, cutover, recompute, new service, new dependency, breaking public API | sync tech | reversible but expensive. Test: would it deserve an ADR? |
| Structure: external contract, lost data, a dependency spread everywhere | sync tech, slow, several people | irreversible in practice |
| A methodology that does not exist yet | sync methodology | a PR review cannot settle unwritten science |

**Guards that force sync whatever the rest says**: the feature touches authentication or
authorization, needs a schema migration or a new dependency, writes to a production
database, or reopens a decision recorded in an ADR or a `## Decisions` section.

**What does not force sync**: the size of the diff, the fact that a data owner produced
the data on display, or a "not for now" advice from the `gate` skill.

## The question

One question, the recommended option first with `(Recommended)` and its one-line reason:

- **Autonomy**: "I publish the spec, implement, and open the PR. Reviewers: <handles>."
- **Sync tech**: "I publish the spec and ask <owner> to decide <question> before code."
- **Sync methodology**: "I publish the spec and ask <owner> to decide <question> before code."
- **Spec only**: "I publish the spec and stop. The issue moves to `To dev`."

If the user already gave the path ("go all the way to the PR"), take it and do not ask.

## Publish (every path)

1. Append `## Design` and `## Tech spec` to the body. Replace a section that already
   exists; never duplicate it. Use `mktemp` for the body file: a fixed path lets two
   concurrent runs overwrite each other.
2. Set the priority.
3. **Swap the assignee.** Read the current one, then remove it and add the new one in the
   same command. Adding alone stacks two assignees, and an issue with two owners has none.
   The `${CUR:+--remove-assignee "$CUR"}` shortcut breaks under zsh, where the expansion
   arrives as one argument. Pass the flags explicitly and read the assignees back.

## Autonomy path

1. Status `In Progress`.
2. Create a worktree (see `wt-new`). Never work in the shared checkout.
3. Implement the spec, following the patterns cited in `Existing`. Tests next to the code.
4. **If an architecture or methodology decision appears on the way, stop.** Commit and
   push the current state, open a draft PR that describes the stop point, comment on the
   issue with the question for the named owner, and move the status to `Design to review`.
   Do not decide in the owner's place to finish the PR.
5. Run the checks at CI parity (see `config.md`). Targeted checks do not predict CI.
6. Open the PR with `open-pr`. Body: what the user now sees, one line per reviewer with
   the question asked of them, `## Methodo & data decisions`, and agent context under a
   `<details>` block.
7. Status `Dev to review` on the issue and every linked issue.
8. Recap: PR link, reviewers, checks run, what was not verified, debatable points.

## Sync path

1. Publish the spec. Open questions are addressed by name and phrased as a choice: "A or
   B? I recommend A because...". Never "what do you think?".
2. Status `Design to review`. The assignee is the owner who must decide.
3. One sync comment under 500 characters: one line per person, their question, and what
   happens once it is settled.

## Rules

1. Explore before you write the design.
2. One question per run, the path, and only if the user has not given it.
3. Autonomy by default. Sync is justified by a line of the criterion. Diff size plays no part.
4. One assignee, swapped, read back.
5. Verified paths, cited ADRs.
6. The conversation archives the reasoning. The issue and the PR carry the distillate,
   with agent detail under `<details>`.
