# fix-review

Address the review comments of a pull request, end to end, without asking for
confirmation at each step.

## Scope

- No argument: the PR of the current branch.
- A PR number: that PR.
- `all`: every open PR you authored with unaddressed comments, one at a time.

## Step 0: isolation

Work in a dedicated worktree on the PR branch (see `wt-new`, Mode B). Never in the shared
checkout.

**The concurrency lock must be cross-clone.** When the same skill can run from several
clones or machines, a lock inside one clone protects nothing. Take a lock keyed on the PR
number in a location every run sees (for example `~/.claude/state/fix-review-<pr>.lock`,
created with `mkdir`, which is atomic). Release it in every exit path.

## Step 1: start state, conflict then CI

Read the state before implementing anything.

### Conflicts with the base: merge the base

**1. Resynchronise only on a real conflict.** If the base branch does not require
up-to-date branches, a branch that is behind merges fine. Merging the base "to be up to
date" only restarts CI, and makes the PR inherit a red that belongs to the base. That
happened once: a PR stayed red for an hour on a test it never touched.

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus --jq '"\(.mergeable)/\(.mergeStateStatus)"'
```

`UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN` is not an answer: GitHub recomputes in the background and serves a stale
value meanwhile, and keeps serving it after the fact. Ask again after 5 seconds, up to
three times, then decide locally:

```bash
git -C "$WT" fetch -q origin "$BASE" "$BRANCH"
local=$(git -C "$WT" rev-parse "origin/$BRANCH")
head=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
[ "$local" = "$head" ] || git -C "$WT" fetch -q --force origin "$BRANCH"
git -C "$WT" merge-tree --write-tree "origin/$BASE" "origin/$BRANCH" | grep -c '^CONFLICT'
```

Fetching the base alone is not enough: the local branch ref stays at yesterday's commit,
and `merge-tree` reports a conflict the remote already resolved. Compare with
`headRefOid` first.

**2. Merge the base. Do not rebase.** A rebase rewrites pushed commits and needs a force push whose
lease protects nothing once a fetch happened in between, and this skill can run on two
machines.

**3. What does not resolve, give back.** `git merge --abort`, push nothing, and report it,
as soon as a conflicting file is:

- a migration or schema file;
- a lockfile: it regenerates, it does not get stitched by hand;
- authentication or authorization code;
- a file where both sides carry the same intent, beyond the same lines. Two
  implementations of one request do not merge: one is redundant. Two PRs once fixed the
  same defect each on its side, their additions were adjacent without overlap, git kept
  both, and the base carried a duplicate entry nobody flagged.

Never `-X ours` or `-X theirs`: a global strategy that silently drops one whole side.

**4. Verify after.** A resolution that compiles is not always right. One that does not
compile is certainly wrong. Run type-check and lint on the merge result before you push.
After each resolution, look for duplicate definitions in the touched files as well as
markers: when both sides added the same function, git keeps both without a marker. In a
compiled language that breaks the build. In TOML, YAML or a list, it passes silently.

### CI at arrival: four reds, one action each

| Red | How to recognise it | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Stale | the run predates the last merge on the base, and the failing file is not in the diff | re-run the failed jobs |
| Flaky | a timing or ordering assertion foreign to the diff | re-run, and name it in the report. A silent flaky comes back |
| Real | the failing file is in the diff | fix it |
| Inherited | stacked PR, the failing line comes from the PR below | fix it in the PR below, then merge that base into this one |

The discriminating test is the same each time: cross the file named by the failing log
with the files of the PR.

**Stacked PRs**: CI tests the PR merged into its base, so a defect in the base turns every
PR above it red. Fixing it in the upper PR duplicates it. Fixing it only below is not
enough either, because a re-run replays the original merge. Fix it where the line lives,
then merge that base into the PR above and push.

## Step 2: collect the comments

Review comments live in three places: review bodies, inline review threads, and issue
comments on the PR. Read all three. Skip threads already resolved, and comments already
answered by a later commit.

## Step 3: triage

For each comment: implement, answer with a reason, or escalate.

- A comment that requires a product decision nobody made: say so in the reply and leave
  it for arbitration. Do not decide it to close the thread.
- Close the defect. A closed comment over a live bug is worse than an open one. If a displayed number is wrong, fix the computation.
  Hiding the display closes the comment and keeps the bug.

## Step 4: implement, check, push once

Implement every accepted comment and the real CI red in **the same push**. Two pushes on
one PR mean two full CI runs and two notifications to reviewers for one useful round.

Run the checks of the touched layers. Then push.

## Step 5: after the push, one repair round, no more

Wait for the verdict, bounded. The aggregate check only appears once CI finishes, so
asking it whether CI is done returns `null`, which looks like a failure. "Done" means no
check is still queued or in progress.

```bash
deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + 600 )); verdict=running
while :; do
  read -r pending failed <<<"$(gh pr view "$PR" --json statusCheckRollup --jq '
    [ .statusCheckRollup[]? ] as $c
    | "\([$c[] | select(.status=="QUEUED" or .status=="IN_PROGRESS")] | length) \([$c[] | select(.conclusion=="FAILURE" or .conclusion=="TIMED_OUT")] | length)"')"
  if [ "$pending" = "0" ]; then
    [ "$failed" = "0" ] && verdict=green || verdict=red
    break
  fi
  [ "$(date +%s)" -ge "$deadline" ] && break
  sleep 30
done
```

- **Green**: continue.
- **Red**: fix, push, and stop there. One round only. A fix-push-wait loop without a cap
  burns the budget and pushes code that gets less and less review.
- **Still running after 10 minutes**: stop waiting, report it with the link. "CI still
  running" is an honest result. Letting people believe it is green is not.

`timeout` does not exist on macOS by default: bound the loop yourself.

## Step 6: re-request review

Re-request review only from reviewers whose comments you addressed. Never close, reopen,
toggle draft or change the base to wake CI.

## Step 7: report

Per PR: addressed, left aside with the reason, and "your attention" items (conflicts given
back, decisions to make, flaky tests seen).
