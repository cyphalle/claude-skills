# open-pr

Open a pull request that a reviewer can act on. The checks run before the PR exists, so
CI is not the thing that tells the team your branch does not build.

**Why every PR goes through this skill.** A 60-day audit found that 82% of PRs were opened
with a bare `gh pr create` typed in free conversation. They skipped the layer checks, the
body template and the reviewer routing. A rule that lives in a command only works when the
command is the only door.

## Step 0: resolve the base

```bash
case "$(git branch --show-current)" in
  hotfix/*) BASE=main ;;
  *)        BASE=develop ;;
esac
```

A stacked PR targets the branch below it. Nothing can infer that, so set `BASE` by hand.
A stacked PR opened against the main base shows every commit of the branch below as yours.

## Step 1: run the checks that match the diff (blocking)

```bash
git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD" --stat
```

Pick the checks from the "Checks per layer" table of `config.md`. Several layers touched
means all of them. A failing check is fixed, committed and re-run before going further. A
red branch costs the reviewer a round trip and adds a patch commit to the history.

Check that each check actually compiles the changed code. A check pinned to one package
passes on a diff limited to another package without compiling a single changed line.

**Stacked PR touching a compiled language**: format and lint always run, they are cheap.
Tests may narrow to the touched packages on one condition: you wait for the CI verdict
before you ask anyone to review. Narrowing trades wall-clock time. You still get the full verdict before review.

Skip this step only when the diff holds no code (docs, markdown, skills), and say so.

## Step 2: write the body

### 2a. Linked issues

An issue the PR resolves without a closing keyword stays open after merge and never moves
on the board. Collect candidates from three sources: the branch name, the commit messages,
and your open assigned issues. Every candidate passes two filters:

1. **It is open.** Read it. A closed issue, or a number that is a PR, drops out.
2. **It is about this diff.** A number that exists but describes something else drops out.

Never write a number you have not read. Then pick the verb without asking:

- `Closes #<n>.` when the PR delivers the whole issue.
- a bare `#<n>` when the PR advances it without closing it.

### 2b. Number every decision and name its ratifier

The diff carries choices its author took alone. Each one is written with the alternative
set aside and the person who ratifies it, above the fold, because that is the only half a
ratifier reads.

```markdown
## Decisions to ratify
- D1. Tech. <choice>. Set aside: <alternative>, because <why>. Ratifier: @<backend-owner>.
- D2. Methodo. <choice>. Set aside: <alternative>, because <why>. Ratifier: @<methodology-owner>.
```

A decision is a choice between two options a reviewer could argue for: a new table, a new
dependency, a cache strategy, a formula, a unit, a source, an aggregation rule, a default
for a missing value. A rename or an obvious fix is not one. Do not invent a deliberation
to fill the section.

A line that only applies a choice made elsewhere stays as a trace, cites where the choice
was made, and names no ratifier.

**Every ratifier named is a reviewer. Every reviewer has a line.** A ratifier who is not
requested never sees the line. A reviewer requested with nothing to ratify is the
over-calling that teaches people to ignore requests: one audit counted 19 requests to a
data owner in two weeks for 5 answers, and only one of the 19 touched their domain.

The request reads "ratify or correct". Never "what do you think": that wording reopens the
deliberation the PR was meant to close.

### 2c. Give each reviewer a reading level

```markdown
## Reviewers
- @<handle>. Deep, about 1 h. Focus: the migration and the backfill query. Ratify or correct D1.
- @<handle>. Light, 5 min. Ratify or correct D2. Nothing else to read.
- @<handle>. Standard, about 20 min. Focus: the drawer component. No decision to ratify.
```

| Level | Time | What the reviewer does | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deep | about 1 h | reads their layer line by line, runs the test plan | migration, auth change, infra apply, computation of a user-visible figure, new table or dependency, more than 400 changed lines |
| Standard | about 20 min | reads their layer, runs the first scenario | any other change in their layer |
| Light | about 5 min | reads above the fold only, ratifies their `D<n>` lines | ratification only, or docs, labels, style |

### 2d. A test plan a reviewer can run cold

`Not relevant for this PR.` is not an accepted value.

1. **Where, and what to build locally.** A frontend-only diff tests on its preview
   deployment. A backend diff tests locally, because a preview runs against the shared dev
   API and does not contain the change. Write the build commands in order.
2. **Setup names real data.** "Any project where X shows" sends the reviewer hunting. Name
   a project on the dev environment that exhibits the case.
3. **One to three scenarios** on the golden path, on what CI does not cover. Numbered
   steps naming the exact screen and control, and an observable **Expected**.
4. **A change with no UI** still gets a scenario: the request to send, the command to run,
   the row to read, and the value that must come back.

### 2e. Check the draft before step 3

- linked issues, with their verb;
- one ratifier per decided line, numbered, each also a reviewer;
- one reviewer line per reviewer, every `D<n>` cited by exactly one line;
- above the fold, under 1 500 characters (see `writing-voice`);
- a test plan with a place, a build, a setup and an expected result.

## Step 3: assignee and reviewers

**One assignee, always: the author.** The author owns what they merge. A PR with no
assignee is in nobody's queue.

**At least one reviewer, from the layer of the diff**, using the owners table of
`config.md`. Keep a fallback per layer for when the owner is the author: GitHub refuses
the author as reviewer.

A migration is a schema gesture and belongs to the backend owner. The data owner owns
what is inside the tables. The shape belongs to the backend owner.

**Request reviewers on a ready PR only.** GitHub sends the review email when
the reviewer is added, and sends nothing when a draft later turns ready. A reviewer added
to a draft never hears that the PR waits for them.

```bash
# ready from the start
gh pr create --base "$BASE" --title "<scope>/<type>: <description>" \
  --body-file <file> --assignee @me --reviewer <handles>

# draft: no reviewers yet
gh pr create --draft --base "$BASE" --title "..." --body-file <file> --assignee @me
# later: ready first, reviewers second
gh pr ready <n> && gh pr edit <n> --add-reviewer <handles>
```

## Step 4: move the linked issues

Every issue the PR closes or advances goes to `Dev to review`, sub-issues included. A PR
that closes three issues moves three.

## Step 5: verify

```bash
gh pr view <n> --json assignees,reviewRequests,baseRefName,isDraft
```

- On a draft, the reviewer list must be empty. A request found there went out too early:
  remove it and add it again once the PR is ready.
- On a ready PR, an empty reviewer list means the PR will rot. Fix it now.
- A base different from step 0 means the diff on display is not the one you checked.

## Never

Never close and reopen a PR, toggle draft, or change its base to wake CI up. After a fix,
stop at the local verification and the push, and report the state honestly.
