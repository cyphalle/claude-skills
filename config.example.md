# Team config

Every skill in this repository reads its team-specific facts from one file. Copy this file to
`~/.claude/skills/config.md` and fill it in. A skill never guesses a handle, a branch or a
board ID: when a value is missing here, the skill stops and says which value it needs.

## Owners

One owner per domain. The owner signs off on choices in their domain. Skills route reviews,
handoffs and ratification requests from this table.

| Domain | Owner | GitHub handle | Review mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend, API, schema migrations, SQL | `<name>` | `<handle>` | upstream or on the diff |
| Frontend, app, infra, CI | `<name>` | `<handle>` | upstream or on the diff |
| Data: reference table contents, seeds, sources | `<name>` | `<handle>` | ratify on the diff only |
| Methodology: formulas, thresholds, units | `<name>` | `<handle>` | ratify on the diff only |
| Product and tech lead (default assignee) | `<name>` | `<handle>` | |

"Ratify on the diff only" marks owners who answer a written choice better than an open
question. Skills never send them an open question upstream. They decide, write the choice
with the rejected alternative, and ask for "ratify or correct" in the pull request.
